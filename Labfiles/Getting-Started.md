### Getting Started with the Lab

1. You can see a virtual machine desktop ðŸ’» (**LABVM**) loaded on the left side of your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can also connect to the virtual machine using any RDP client using the **LABVM** credentials provided in the **Environment** tab.

1. Once you are in the **Environment** tab click on the **GitHub Credentials** option to get GitHub user credentials. The credentials will also be emailed to your registered email address. You can also open the Lab Guide in a separate, and full window by selecting **Split Window** from the upper right corner. Also, you can start, stop, and restart virtual machines from the **Resources** tab.

1. Navigate to GitHub login page using the provided URL below:
   ```
   https://github.com/login
   ```
   
1. On the **Sign in to GitHub** tab, you will see the login screen. In that screen, enter the following **email** **(1)** and **password** **(2)**. Then click on **Sign in** **(3)**. 

   >**Note**: To get GitHub credentials navigate to the **Environment** tab and click on the **GitHub Credentials** option to view the key-value pairs of the **GitHub UserEmail**, and **GitHub Password**. You can use the copy buttons under the actions column to have the values copied instantly. Alternatively, it is suggested to have the values copied over onto a notepad for easy accessibility.

1. Next, to get the authentication code, sign in to Outlook (https://outlook.office365.com/mail/) with the git credentials within the Environment tab from the previous step. Once you have logged into Outlook, find the recent email containing the verification code. Enter the verification code and click on **Verify**.

   >**Note:** The email containing the verification code can sometimes creep into the archive/spam folders within your Outlook.

1. Right-click on the **Start course** given below, click on the **Copy link**, and navigate to the link inside LabVM in the Edge browser where you have logged into GitHub in the previous steps.

   <!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
   'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
     template_owner: 'skills',
     template_name: 'copilot-codespaces-vscode',
     owner: '@me',
     name: 'skills-copilot-codespaces-vscode',
     description: 'My clone repository',
     visibility: 'public',
   }).toString()
   -->
