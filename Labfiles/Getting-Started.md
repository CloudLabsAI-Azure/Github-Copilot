As a result of enabling Copilot in Codespaces, you will experience increased productivity with real-time code suggestions, improved code quality, and accelerated learning and onboarding.
- **Exploring AI-Driven Code Suggestions in JavaScript** : Examines how AI enhances JavaScript coding with real-time completions, bug detection, optimizations, and efficiency improvements. By enabling Copilot in a Codespace, you will experience increased productivity with real-time code suggestions while adding and writing a JavaScript file, streamlining the process of pushing code to their repository, and adhering to best practices, enhancing overall code quality and reducing errors.
- **Exploring Python with GitHub Copilot** : GitHub Copilot offers excellent suggestions for languages like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and more, and assists with database queries. As a result of this exercise, you would have successfully added Python method code with real-time suggestions from GitHub Copilot, viewed multiple code suggestions in the Copilot tab, and pushed the refined code to their repository from the VS Code Codespace.
- **Using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate ARM and Terraform code with Copilot** : Provides coding assistance directly within supported IDEs, offering code suggestions, explanations, unit tests, and bug fixes. Enabling Copilot in Codespaces will result in increased productivity with real-time code suggestions and enhanced code quality while generating ARM, Terraform and PowerShell scripts to deploy resources to Azure.
- **Using GitHub Copilot for Code Refactoring** : Enhances code quality by restructuring for readability, maintainability, and performance without altering external behavior, reducing technical debt and bugs.
- **Using IDEs such as JetBrains IntelliJ for Java** : GitHub Copilot enhances Java coding in IntelliJ by offering intelligent suggestions and auto-completion, elevating productivity and code quality.
- **Enhancing Web Accessibility with GitHub Copilot Chat and Accessibility Insights** : GitHub Copilot Chat accelerates coding with AI-powered suggestions, while Accessibility Insights for Web ensures inclusive, accessible web content.
- **Using GitHub Copilot for T-SQL and YAML Code [Optional]** : Leverage GitHub Copilot to generate code in T-SQL and YAML, using comments to guide its suggestions.
- **Generating Documentation Using GitHub Copilot [Optional]** : Streamlines documentation by auto-generating comments, Markdown, and ensuring consistency, enhancing project accessibility.
- **Working with the Copilot for Machine Learning [Optional]** : Using GitHub Copilot with ML frameworks for tasks such as data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Creating a Mini Game with GitHub Copilot [Optional]** : Build a mini game, refining Python skills in console app development.

## Pre-requisites

Fundamental knowledge of **Visual Studio Code** and popular **programming languages** such as Python, Javascript, C# etc.

## Architecture

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by suggesting code snippets and completing code based on the context provided.

## Login to GitHub

1. In the LABVM desktop search for **Microsoft Edge** **(1)**, click on **Microsoft Edge** **(2)** browser.

   ![](../media/Edge.png)

1. Navigate to GitHub login page using the provided URL below:
   ```
   https://github.com/login
   ```
   
1. On the **Sign in to GitHub** tab, you will see the login screen. In that screen, enter the following **email** **(1)** and **password** **(2)**. Then click on **Sign in** **(3)**. 

   >**Note**: To get GitHub credentials navigate to the **Environment** tab and click on the **GitHub Credentials** option to view the key-value pairs of the **GitHub UserEmail**, and **GitHub Password**. You can use the copy buttons under the actions column to have the values copied instantly. Alternatively, it is suggested to have the values copied over onto a notepad for easy accessibility.
