# GitHub Copilot Innovation Workshop

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to explore how AI tools like GitHub Copilot and GitHub Codespaces enhance the development process. By providing contextual suggestions and creating consistent, cloud-hosted development environments, these tools streamline coding and improve efficiency. The lab focuses on various features and applications of GitHub Copilot, demonstrating how it can assist with real-time code completions, bug detection, and optimizations across different programming languages and development tasks.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will improve your coding workflow by leveraging AI-powered tools. You will:

- **Using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate ARM and Terraform code with Copilot** : This hands-on exercise aims to provide coding assistance directly within supported IDEs, offering code suggestions, explanations, unit tests, and bug fixes. Enabling Copilot in Codespaces will result in increased productivity with real-time code suggestions and enhanced code quality while generating ARM, Terraform and PowerShell scripts to deploy resources to Azure.

## Pre-requisites

Fundamental knowledge of **Visual Studio Code** and popular **programming languages** such as Python, Javascript, C# etc.

## Architecture

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by suggesting code snippets and completing code based on the context provided. GitHub Copilot Chat complements this by offering an interactive chat interface where developers can ask questions and receive code suggestions and debugging assistance. Integrated with Visual Studio Code Codespaces, GitHub Copilot benefits from cloud-hosted development environments, ensuring consistency and reliability from anywhere. To enhance web development, Accessibility Insights for Web helps identify and resolve accessibility issues, ensuring inclusive web applications. GitHub Copilot supports various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of coding tasks.
