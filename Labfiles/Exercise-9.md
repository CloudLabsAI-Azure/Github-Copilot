# Exercise 9: Generating Documentation Using GitHub Copilot [Optional]

### Estimated Duration: 10 minutes

GitHub Copilot can help streamline the process of generating documentation for your software projects. It assists by auto-generating code comments, creating Markdown documentation, providing templates for common sections, ensuring grammar and style consistency, and cross-referencing code and documentation. This tool can save time and improve the quality of your project's documentation, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
