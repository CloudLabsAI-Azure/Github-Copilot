# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

### Overall Estimated Duration: 20 minutes

## Overview
 
GitHub Copilot is the world's first at-scale AI developer tool that can help you write code faster with less work. GitHub Copilot uses comments and code context to instantly suggest specific lines of code and the entire functions.

Research has found GitHub Copilot helps developers code faster, focus on solving bigger problems, stay in the flow longer, and feel more fulfilled with their work.

Powered by OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot's generative, pretrained language model was created by OpenAI. An extension is available for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## Objective 

 - **Getting Started with Github Copilot** : Create and configure a GitHub repository, set Visual Studio Code as the preferred editor for seamless code editing and version control, and explore the advantages of using GitHub and GitHub Copilot for collaborative development and AI-driven code assistance.

## Prerequisites

 - Basic understanding of GitHub fundamentals
 - A GitHub Enterprise Cloud administrator account

## Architecture

The process involves logging into GitHub for authentication and creating a new repository to securely store and manage code. This setup allows users to efficiently store, manage, and version control their code on GitHub.
