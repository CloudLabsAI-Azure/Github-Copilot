# Getting Started with Your Code Suggestions with GitHub Copilot in Codespaces using VS Code

## Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

This lab introduces you to using GitHub Copilot within Codespaces in Visual Studio Code to enhance your coding workflow. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by suggesting whole lines or blocks of code as they type, making the coding process faster and more efficient. In this lab, you will learn how to set up and use GitHub Copilot in a Codespace, explore its various features, and understand how to leverage its capabilities to improve your productivity and code quality. By the end, you'll be familiar with integrating AI-driven code suggestions into your development environment seamlessly.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Add JavaScript File**: Create a JavaScript file, link it to an HTML document, write basic JavaScript, manipulate the DOM, and use console logging and debugging tools to test code.

2. **Push Code from Codespace**: Use Git commands (`add`, `commit`, `push`), manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and push changes securely using SSH or HTTPS.

3. **Best Practices for GitHub Copilot**: Enable Copilot, use it for code suggestions, manage AI-generated code carefully to maintain quality and security, and consider ethical implications.

## Pre-Requisites

Participants should have: Basic knowledge and understanding of the following

- **GitHub Account**: A valid GitHub account. Ensure that you are logged into your GitHub account to access GitHub Codespaces and Copilot.
- **Basic Knowledge of Git and GitHub**: Familiarity with Git version control system and basic GitHub concepts like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components. Youâ€™ll begin by setting up a development environment using GitHub Codespaces, which provides a cloud-based, customizable workspace with integrated development tools. Next, you'll create a new JavaScript file within the Codespace, link it to an HTML file, and write JavaScript code that interacts with the web page's DOM. The code is managed using Git, allowing for version control and collaboration. You will perform Git operations (`add`, `commit`, `push`) to save your changes and push them to a remote GitHub repository. Throughout the development process, GitHub Copilot will provide AI-powered code suggestions to enhance productivity and maintain high code quality. The architecture integrates development, version control, collaboration, and AI assistance, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Add a JavaScript File and Begin Coding**: Start by creating a new JavaScript file in your project and linking it to an HTML page. Write JavaScript code to interact with the web page's DOM, and use tools like the browser console for testing and debugging.

2. **Push Your Code to the Repository from Codespace**: Within GitHub Codespaces, use Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to track your changes, manage version control, and push your updates to the remote repository for collaboration.

3. **Using GitHub Copilot Effectively**: Activate GitHub Copilot in your development environment to leverage AI-assisted code suggestions, carefully review and refine these suggestions to ensure code quality, security, and alignment with best practices.
