Then you can provide a similar prompt as given to know the reason behind the error and use the advanced capabilities of the **GitHub Copilot Workspace** to rectify the error: `@workspace. Fix the issue in the app.js file.`

    >**Note:** Make sure you use the **@workspace** command in the chatbox to utilize the workspace feature so that it can analyze the whole workspace files and directories of your application and provide you with the best resolution for the error that doesn't conflict with any other component.

1. You will get an output similar to this:

    ![](../media/file16.png)

    Go through the response and resolve the errors using the steps provided in it.

1. Now, when all the errors have been fixed, you can ask Copilot how to run your application by prompting `@workspace. How can I run this app?` and submitting it.

    Follow the steps provided by it and run your application.

    ![](../media/file17.png)

1. You can also check if all the pre-requisites required to run your **Expense Tracker** app are already in place by providing the Copilot with the prompt `@workspace. What are the prerequisites I should install to run this app?`

    ![](../media/file18.png)

    Closely review the response generated by the **GitHub Copilot** using its workspace feature and make sure that all these prerequisites are installed. If not, install them using the steps mentioned in your answer.

1. Run the application, and it will open in your **Edge** browser as below:

### Task 2: Utilize the Capabilities of File Referencing

**File Referencing in GitHub Copilot** refers to the AI's ability to understand and interpret the context of your project by considering the information in other files within your workspace.

When you're working on a specific file in your codebase, **GitHub Copilot** can take into account the information, functions, classes, or variables defined in other files of your project. This means it doesn't just provide suggestions based on the current file you're working on; it can also reference other files to give you more accurate and relevant code completions. This feature is particularly useful when you're working on large projects where code is spread across multiple files. **GitHub Copilot's** ability to reference other files allows it to better understand the bigger picture of your project, resulting in more context-aware suggestions. This can significantly improve your coding efficiency and the overall quality of your code.

In this task, you will be utilizing the **GitHub Copilot File Referencing** capability to enhance coding efficiency by providing contextually relevant code suggestions. To use the File Referencing feature, follow the below steps:

1. Open your Expense Tracker project in **VS Code**, where you are signed in using the CloudLabs provided Github account details.

    ![](../media/vscode-launch.png)

1. From the left pane, select the **Chat** icon. You will be provided with the **GitHub Copilot** welcome chat window.

    ![](../media/file20.png)

1. In the textbox, enter **@** **(1)** and select **Workspace** **(2)** to activate the **GitHub Copilot Workspace** agent. You need this agent to analyze your whole workspace so that it can provide accurate answers and the related code blocks by referencing the correct files.

    ![](../media/file21.png)

1. Now, you can use the following prompt to understand how the file referencing feature works in **GitHub Copilot**. It can accurately provide the answer for the file to which you refer: `What is the purpose of the index.js file in my project?`

    The **GitHub Copilot** will make reference to the information, functions, classes, or variables defined in the file you asked the question about and will provide you with a detailed explanation of what is in the **index.js**. Not just the explanation; it will also provide you with the related code accompanied by the answer, referenced in the provided file.

    The **GitHub Copilot** also automatically references the additional files in your project that may be required to provide you with the best answer. To get information about those files, select **Used n references** (where **n** is the total number of files referenced from your current project) present at the start of the answer and see all the files that **GitHub Copilot** referenced to provide you with the answer.

    ![](../media/file22.png)

    Some more prompts that you can provide to understand the feature of file referencing are:

    ```
    @workspace What does the ExpenseList.js file do in my application?
    ```
    ```
    @workspace What is the purpose of the app.js file in my project?
    ```
    ```
    @workspace How can I change the CSS for my application?
    ```
    
#### **Adding a new feature in the application using File Reference:**

In this task, you will be utilizing the file reference capability to integrate a new feature in your **Expense Tracker** application. You will include a **Date** field in the **ExpenseForm** document and display it in **ExpenseItem**, and then you, will be able to sort the expenses by date in the **ExpenseList** component.

To do so, follow the below steps:

1. Open your project in VS Code, where you are signed in using the CloudLabs provided Github account details.

    ![](../media/vscode-launch.png)

1. From the left pane, select the **Chat** icon. You will be provided with the **GitHub Copilot** welcome chat window.

    ![](../media/file23.png)

1. In the textbox, enter **@ (1)** and select **Workspace (2)** to activate the **GitHub Copilot Workspace** agent. You need this agent to analyze your whole workspace so that it can provide accurate answers and the related code blocks by referencing the correct files.

    ![](../media/file24.png)

1. Now, provide this prompt to include a new **Data** field in the components and let users sort their expenses accordingly: `How can I modify the ExpenseForm component to include a date field, display this date in the ExpenseItem component, and sort the expenses by date in the ExpenseList component?`

1. The **GitHub Copilot**  feature will reference the files you asked for in the prompts as well as analyze your whole workspace and provide you with the best possible answer. It will provide you with the code snippets that you can add to the **ExpenseForm**, **ExpenseItem**, and **ExpenseList** components accordingly. You can also view the files it referenced while providing you with the answer by selecting **Used n references** (where n is the number of files referred) present at the start of the response.

    ![](../media/file25.png)

1. You can go through the response, make the changes suggested by the **GitHub Copilot** using its file referencing feature, and edit the components as provided in the answer.

1. Run the app and verify the **Date** component is added and working properly.
