# Exercise 11: GitHub Copilot + Accessibility Insights for Web

Duration: 90 minutes

**GitHub Copilot Chat** is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers by suggesting code snippets and solutions based on context. This tool can significantly speed up the development process by providing relevant code suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.

**Accessibility Insights for Web** is a powerful, user-friendly tool that helps make web content accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. By integrating this tool into the development and testing process, web developers can ensure their websites meet accessibility standards, enhancing usability and inclusivity.

Accessible University (AU) is a fictional university home page designed to demonstrate a variety of common web design problems that result in visitors with disabilities being unable to access content or features.

Use the AU site to:

1. Demonstrate common web accessibility principles at trainings, presentations, and workshops on accessible web design.
   
1. Learn common web accessibility problems and solutions in an easy-to-understand way.

In this exercise, you will use Accessibility Insights for Web to identify accessibility issues on a sample website and then employ GitHub Copilot Chat to generate and implement code fixes for these issues. The target website, Accessible University (AU), is a fictional homepage designed to showcase common web design problems that hinder accessibility. By the end of this exercise, you will have enhanced the accessibility of the AU site, making it more user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.
